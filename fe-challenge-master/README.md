![Desktop Preview](./design/desktop.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to check out this code challenge.

**To complete this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The Challenge

Your goal is to create a landing page that looks as close as possible to the designs included in the design folder.

**Please do not use any third-party libraries, frameworks, or components for this challenge. All markup and code should be written from scratch in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

### General Notes

- Links don't need to point anywhere (`#` works fine)
- The form doesn't need to lead anywhere but it does need to be styled
- Menu(s) should be implemented but it's up to you how you'd like them to function
- The mobile layout is only available in `.png` format - it is not included in the Sketch or Figma files
- If you're unable to open the `.sketch` or `.fig` file, please refer to the `.pdf` or `.png` files~ instead
- If you're unsure about something, please use your best judgment to determine a solution

### High Priority Items

Below are things you should pay particular attention to when completing this challenge.
